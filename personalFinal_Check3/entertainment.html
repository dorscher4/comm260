                        Today, entertainment in the form of video games is at an all time high. Not only are there
                        next-gen consoles that are unlike any we've seen before, but there are a large number of 
                        ways for people to consume this content other than actually playing these games for themselves.

                        Most people today have heard of YouTube, but Twitch is a platform that is still growing. It is a 
                        place where people can live stream content, a majority of which being video games, and interact
                        with the people watching in real time. Many visit the site to watch and talk to their favorite
                        creators from YouTube or streamers that have made their name on Twitch itself. Others may come to 
                        watch the competitiveness and the skill involve in various eSports.
