                    The picture on the right is from my public speaking class my first semester.
                    Like a lot of other people, I did not enjoy getting up in front of a class 
                    and speaking, and I still don’t really. This is one of a few classes I took
                    my first semester that I didn’t enjoy very much, but does anyone enjoy their
                    general classes? Especially public speaking. This image and experience can
                    serve as an example to my path in finding my major at NDSU. It took a 
                    good number of classes and research for me to find something that I really
                    took interest in. One thing I found important in that search was 
                    exploring my options, and along the way using the classes that I didn’t
                    enjoy to narrow down the search for what I would do for the rest of my
                    experience at NDSU.

                    What’s the best part about going to college? Finding yourself? New friends?
                    Eating all you want? For me it’s all of that, and most importantly, being 
                    able to do it with my best friend. As fun as you can make your experience 
                    at college, you will always find yourself in a position with a lot of work 
                    and stress. We all need someone we can go to when we are feeling stressed 
                    feel lost and overwhelmed in life. I’m lucking I get to be able to see that 
                    someone everyday and have a constant support system when things get tough. 
                    I would encourage anyone to reach out to a friend, or make one, so you have 
                    a way to outlet when things get difficult. And don’t forget to return the 
                    favor.
