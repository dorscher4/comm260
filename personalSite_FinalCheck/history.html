                        The precense of video games can trace back to the 50s, where new computer scientists created their 
                        own computer games for research or for fun. Who would have known that 70 years later it would become
                        a multi billion dollar industry, reaching people all over the world.

                        Above is an image of an Atari-2600, one of the first gaming systems to be produced and sold to the public.
                        Since then, the gaming industry evolved to making newer, faster consoles with more advanced games to play.
                        Eventually, people were able to play with others online from all around the world. This opened the door for
                        competetive gaming and the potential for gaming to become a social activity.

                    <p>
                        Today we have virtual reality simulators, the most immersive experience to playing video games there has
                        ever been. Back in the 50s, computer scientists would not believe the type of technology we have today.
                        Being able to put on a headset and join a virtual world where you can live in your favorite game would
                        blow their minds.
