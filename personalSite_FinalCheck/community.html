                        Video games are something I've enjoyed my whole life. I've made some of my best friends and continue
                        to interact with them through video games today. There are tons of communities for any game you 
                        are interested in, including casual and serious gaming communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Websites like discord have tons of servers for gaming communities, a lot of which are for specific
                        games and even content creators. Interacting with the gaming community can help anyone create new friends
                        as well as expose you to new games you haven't played. You may also find while playing video games that
                        you will improve your vision, attention and decision making. You can also improve your communication and
                        social skills by interacting in these communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you are having trouble getting into video games, try joining one of these communities and talking to
                        others. Most people find that playing games with others is more fun than by yourself, and getting advice
                        and feedback from more experienced players will help you improve and have more fun playing games.
